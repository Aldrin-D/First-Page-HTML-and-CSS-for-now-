<ul id="list-section">
  <li>I did a simple computing course and it's when I learn about web design.</li>
  <li>Biology: when I was 17, I wanted to be a biology teacher, but I took a different path.</li>

  <li>But some months before I start to work, initialize a technical chemistry course by 2 years, going to work and after to the class.</li>

    After finishing my chemistry course, I give up working on it and recognize that design and other concepts about programming, as I said
